# AoC2020
Advent of code 2020.
Each day, we use a different programming language!
NOTE: My personal laptop took a fall and the screen no longer works, so I'm using a loner for now. I can't download arbitrary langs on it, so I'll fill in the rest of the langs after I get a new laptop.

## List
There's only 25 days, but 26 letters. Idk which day to skip. Probably `W`.
